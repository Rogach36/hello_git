      My name is <span class="name">Aleksey Rogach</span>. Now I am working as a content-manager/web-editor at Samara University. I would like to become a front-end developer. I wish to get the necessary knowledge in order to further apply for the position of junior web-developer. Development attracts me because, unlike the current work of the content manager, it allows not just maintaining the site, but creating it. It is much more complicated, but there is much more creativity. In addition, to create not just modern, but convenient sites - means to benefit society.

        At the basic level I own HTML 5/CSS3, a bit familiar with —Å JS, bootstrap, less. In the middle of last year I attended and successfully completed intensive course HTML & CSS, level 1 (by HTML Academy). After that, I made a few simple sites, using psd layouts to fix my knowledge.

        I graduated from Samara State University with a degree in Russian history in 2006. As I mentioned above, I graduated intensive course from the Academy, before that I took their interactive courses, and a little earlier I attended a level 1 JavaScript course from GeekBrains. JS is given to me with great difficulty, I hope your courses will fill in the missing knowledge and allow me to confidently solve the problems facing junior web developer.
